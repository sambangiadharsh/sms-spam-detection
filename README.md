## Overview

With the increasing amount of unsolicited messages sent via SMS, spam detection has become an important problem to solve. The goal of this project is to create a model that can accurately classify SMS messages into two categories: **spam** and **ham (not spam)**. The dataset contains labeled SMS messages, which can be used for training a machine learning model.
